= Functional requirements

Functional requirements,
in the context of an application,
define the specific features and actions
the application should perform
in response to particular user requests
or under certain conditions.
These are clearly defined specifications
describing the system's behavior,
such as enabling login,
adding products to a shopping cart,
or processing payments.

In short,
functional requirements define
_what_ the application should do,
not _how_ it should do it.
They form the basis for
designing, coding, and testing
the application.

This chapter should be written
*from the client's perspective*,
i.e., how the user can interact
with the application.
It may be divided into subsections
or presented as a bullet-point list.
It is important that
the descriptions are comprehensive
and include
all necessary information.

In addition to that,
formulating those requirements
helps your supervisor
correctly assess
the scope of your work.
