= Non-functional requirements

Non-functional requirements,
in the context of an application,
relate to aspects concerning
the system's quality and characteristics
rather than its direct functions.
They address areas such as
performance, security, availability, scalability, and the user interface.
In practice,
they define how well
the application performs its functions.
Examples include
system response time, the maximum number of concurrent users, and compliance with specific standards.

Non-functional requirements
are essential for ensuring user satisfaction
and the application's success on the market.
