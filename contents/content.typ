= Content #sym.dagger

Be direct.
The thesis should be _as short as possible,
but not shorter than that_.
Meaning that
if you can be more concise without sacrificing readability or quality,
you should be.

Here you should explain in detail
the context of your work,
state-of-the-art of similar tools,
what is different about your approach, etc.
If it gets lengthy,
you can divide it into multiple chapters.

== How much to cite? #sym.dagger

It is impossible to answer this question precisely.
A rule of thumb presents itself as follows:

- Copy-pasting an entire page of academic work
  without any citations
  is a *crime* (copyright).
- Each important aspect of your work
  that is not directly created by you,
  should be backed by citations.
- In the section dedicated to alternative sources / state-of-the-art,
  it is permitted to introduce grouped citations,
  e.g., by introducing a short summary
  and then providing many references at the same time.
- It is permitted to omit the citation of internet webpages
  if authors of referenced texts are unknown.
  In such situations
  you should reference the source broadly,
  e.g., "On IBM's website it can be seen that [...]."

Theses that were prepared and submitted
without the supervisor's active overseeing of the process of creating them
will be rejected.

== How to structure my work? #sym.dagger

It is best to split your chapters
#footnote[Chapters. Not sections, not subsections. Entire chapters.]
into separate files.
Notice how this project consists of `contents` directory with `introduction.typ` and `content.typ` inside,
which are then `#include`d in the `main.typ` file.
This makes it very easy to change the ordering,
separate different topics,
and collaborate.

=== Manual numbering (of pretty much anything) #sym.dagger

Do *not* include any numbering in the names of the files.
E.g., notice that the files are named `introduction.typ` and `content.typ`,
*not* `1-introduction.typ` and `2-content.typ`.
You do *not* want to create such dependencies.
Typst does the heavy-duty job
of automatic numbering and ordering.
Do not interfere with it
without a good reason.
What will happen if you spend a lot of time
to number your files,
and then realize
that you need to introduce a new file/chapter
in the middle?
You are a programmer---apply and respect good programming practices.

This also applies to enumerations or lists (itemizations).
To introduce an enumeration,
use `+`:

#figure(
    caption: [Example of enumeration creation.]
)[
```typst
+ first item
  + first subitem
  + second subitem
+ second item
+ third item
```
]<listing-Example-of-enum-creation>

@listing-Example-of-enum-creation, when rendered,
looks as follows:

+ first item
  + first subitem#footnote[To some,
  using the exact same numbers
  for a sublist
  does not look elegant,
  or even good.
  Fortunately, it is very easy
  to use a `#set` rule
  to change change this appearance.
  See: #link("https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/enum#parameters-numbering")]
  + second subitem
+ second item
+ third item

Using `+` over manual numbering
has a huge advantage---it makes it so that adding a new element in the middle
does not require
changing the numbering
of trailing items.

Use `-` for unordered lists (itemizations):

#figure(
    caption: [Example of itemization creation.]
)[
```typst
- first item
  - first subitem
  - second subitem
- second item
- third item
```
]<listing-Example-of-itemization-creation>

Rendered:

- first item
  - first subitem#footnote[By default,
  this template already changes
  the default look
  of nested itemizations.]
  - second subitem
- second item
- third item

== How to introduce other media content? #sym.dagger

Typst provides a wide array of options
to deal with inputting things like:

- code listings,
- tables,
- images,
- equations.

Let us inspect couple of examples.

=== Code listings #sym.dagger

For inline code use ``` `backticks` ``` (the character above your Tab key),
and to introduce code listings use #raw("```triple backtics```") (preferably with specified language).
For example, to render @listing-Example-of-Kotlin-code-rendered-as-a-code-block,

#figure(
    caption: [Example of Kotlin code rendered as a code block.]
)[
```Kotlin
fun main() {
    val text = getStringOrNull()

    println(text?.length ?: "nothing")
}
```
]<listing-Example-of-Kotlin-code-rendered-as-a-code-block>

code from @listing-Example-of-typesetting-Kotlin-code was used.
Notice that listings' labels (with captions) are placed above them.

#figure(
    caption: [Code used to create @listing-Example-of-Kotlin-code-rendered-as-a-code-block.]
)[
````Typst
#figure(
    caption: [Example of Kotlin code rendered as a code block.]
)[
```Kotlin
fun main() {
    val text = getStringOrNull()

    println(text?.length ?: "nothing")
}
```
]<listing-Example-of-Kotlin-code-rendered-as-a-code-block>
````
]<listing-Example-of-typesetting-Kotlin-code>

Referencing listings is done using `@thisFamiliarSyntax`.
It searches for labels,
which in this are put after the listings
(e.g., `@listing-Example-of-Kotlin-code-rendered-as-a-code-block` creates the following reference: @listing-Example-of-Kotlin-code-rendered-as-a-code-block).

Currently, this template uses the Codly package @CodlyPackage @CodlyDocumentation,
but it is acceptable to present and suggest alternatives
(or at least help out with nicer rendering...).

=== Tables #sym.dagger

Tables are very easy to make.
To make a table
that demonstrates how your final grade issued on a diploma
is calculated,
refer to @listing-Example-of-typesetting-tables.
The rendered table is @tab-Final-grade-calculations.

#figure(
    caption: [Components and calculations of your final grade issued on the diploma.]
)[
    #table(
        columns: (auto, 1fr),
        inset: 8pt,
        table.header([*Symbol*], [*Meaning*]),
        align: (center, left),
        [$a$],[Your GPA.],
        [$b_1$],[Thesis' grade by supervisor.],
        [$b_2$],[Thesis' grade by aux. supervisor.],
        [$c$],[Grade for thesis presentation.],
        [$d_1$],[Grade for answers to question \#1 from diploma exam.],
        [$d_2$],[Grade for answers to question \#2 from diploma exam.],
        [$d_3$],[Grade for answers to question \#3 from diploma exam.],
        table.cell(colspan: 2)[Final grade: $a/2+(b_1+b_2+c)/12+(d_1+d_2+d_3)/12$.]
    )
]<tab-Final-grade-calculations>

#figure(
    caption: [Example commands used to input a table.]
)[
````Typst
#figure(
    caption: "Components and calculations of your final grade issued on the diploma."
)[
    #table(
        columns: (auto, 1fr),
        inset: 8pt,
        table.header([*Symbol*], [*Meaning*]),
        align: (center, left),
        [$a$],[Your GPA.],
        [$b_1$],[Thesis' grade by supervisor.],
        [$b_2$],[Thesis' grade by aux. supervisor.],
        [$c$],[Grade for thesis presentation.],
        [$d_1$],[Grade for answers to question \#1 from diploma exam.],
        [$d_2$],[Grade for answers to question \#2 from diploma exam.],
        [$d_3$],[Grade for answers to question \#3 from diploma exam.],
        table.cell(colspan: 2)[Final grade: $a/2+(b_1+b_2+c)/12+(d_1+d_2+d_3)/12$.]
    )
]<tab-Final-grade-calculations>
````
]<listing-Example-of-typesetting-tables>

It is worth noting
that the calculated grade according to @tab-Final-grade-calculations
may be fractional.
How does it map to
the actual, discrete set of possible grades?
Consult @tab-Final-grade-clamp,
which,
for showcase purposes,
uses slightly different style.

#figure(
    caption: [Mapping of scored grade to the actual grade issued on the diploma.]
)[
    #table(
        columns: (auto, auto),
        inset: 8pt,
        table.header([*Scored grade range*], [*Resulting grade*]),
        align: center,
        [$[2.00;3.00)$], [$2.0$],
        [$[3.00;3.40)$], [$3.0$],
        [$[3.40;3.80)$], [$3.5$],
        [$[3.80;4.20)$], [$4.0$],
        [$[4.20;4.50)$], [$4.5$],
        [$[4.50;5.00)$], [$5.0$],
    )
]<tab-Final-grade-clamp>

=== Images (figures) #sym.dagger

Including images is very easy.
@img-raw-Typst-logo is included as-is,
while @img-smaller-Typst-logo's width
was set to 50% (height was scaled automatically).

#figure(
    caption: [Typst's logo.]
)[
    #image("assets/Typst.png")
] <img-raw-Typst-logo>

#figure(
    caption: [Typst's logo, but smaller.]
)[
    #image("assets/Typst.png", width: 50%)
] <img-smaller-Typst-logo>

Commands used to produce the above output are presented in @listing-Examples-of-image-usage.
Again,
like with tables,
images have labels
placed below them.

#figure(caption: [Example commands used to input images.])[
````Typst
#figure(
    caption: "Typst's logo."
)[
    #image("assets/Typst.png")
] <img-raw-Typst-logo>

#figure(
    caption: [Typst's logo, but smaller.]
)[
    #image("assets/Typst.png", width: 80%)
] <img-smaller-Typst-logo>
````
]<listing-Examples-of-image-usage>

Always try to include images
that are in vector format---rather than raster---so that automatic scaling
is better applied.

=== Equations #sym.dagger

Use LaTeX-like syntax.
For inline equations,
wrap them in a pair of dollar signs (`$`).
For example,
this: `$a x^2+b x+c=0$` will produce: $a x^2+b x+c=0$.
For numbered equations
that are displayed separately,
introduce additional space
between the dollar sign and the equation.
For example,
typing `$ a x^2+b x+c=0 $`
(notice the additional space after the first and before the last `$`---`$ ` and ` $`)
will produce: $ a x^2+b x+c=0 $

Of course,
they are numbered
(thus should be referencable),
so instead of
`$ a x^2+b x+c=0 $`
one should type
`$ a x^2+b x+c=0 $ <eq-Quadratic-example>`
so that it is rendered like this:
$ a x^2+b x+c=0 $ <eq-Quadratic-example>

and referenced like this: @eq-Quadratic-example.

=== Figure functions #sym.dagger

Notice that in case of
listings, tables, and images,
they were wrapped inside a `#figure` call.
This makes them
referencable, have captions,
and be correctly labeled.
Without the `#figure` function call,
they are rendered as-is,
without being correctly labeled.
There are,
of course,
valid use cases for that---the university's logo
displayed on the title page
is an example of such construct.
Professionally,
images are labeled as _figures_,
so make sure the distinction is understood.
